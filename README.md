# Upper-Lower-System
This program standardizes the capitalization of a given string with inconsistent use of uppercase and lowercase letters, based on the following rules:

1. If a word contains more uppercase letters than lowercase letters, the entire word is converted to uppercase.
2. If a word contains more lowercase letters than uppercase letters, the entire word is converted to lowercase.
3. If a word has an equal number of uppercase and lowercase letters, the case of the word is determined by its last character:
   - If the last character is uppercase, the word is converted to uppercase.
   - If the last character is lowercase, the word is converted to lowercase.

The input consists only of letters and spaces.
